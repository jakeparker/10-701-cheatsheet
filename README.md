# _Introduction to Machine Learning_ Cheatsheet
Exams for Carnegie Mellon University's Introduction to Machine Learning (specifically the 700-level variant) are not often closed-book, instead often allowing for a single page of notes if not being fully open-book.

Additionally there is a significant amount of heterogenous material covered in the course, and it is not possible (nor useful) to include all of it on one page (front and back). Personally, I find it easier to recall information given a stimulus either drawn from or associated with the material in question. To this end, this cheatsheet was to be a well categorized collection snippets drawn from course material.

However, I took the course having previously completed the 600-level offering. And found that the majority of new content that I had not yet fully internalized as knowledge came from learning theory. As such I dedicated the the majority of the page front to material relevant to learning theory.

If you decide to use this cheatsheet, I suggest that you refactor it for yourself. At the very least it should be useful as an example.
